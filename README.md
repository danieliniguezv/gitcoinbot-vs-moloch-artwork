# Gitcoinbot & The Public Goods Justice League Vs Moloch

Artwork for Gitcoinbot & The Public Goods Justice League Vs Moloch.

This is an original art series of Gitcoinbots fighting Moloch in the 21st century.

## Bakcground

Moloch was considered to be a Canaanite god associated with child sacrifice. The sacrifice
was done by means of depositing the offerings inside a bronze statue serving as a furnace.

[Moloch](https://mitologia.fandom.com/es/wiki/Moloch) was considered to be a fire purifying symbol, fire which in turn was thought to be
a representation of the soul.

It goes on that Moloch's spirit had fallen into darkness as it transformed into matter. According to
Phoenician and Gnostic tradition men was the embodiment of this tragedy, being the only way to redeem 
this sin by means of sacrificing newborns which where thought to have the characterisitc of being fully 
impregnated with matter.

### Moloch in the 21st Century

It has been thought of Moloch as a deity that demands sacrifice of that which one loves, appreciates
the most (whatever this is). It has appeared in a significant amount of literature and art of all sorts 
over the centuries.

It has been proposed that one of the main problems which we are faced with as communities in the present 
era is coordination failure resulting as a complete lack of cooperation and communication breakdown 
(ironicaly, being this the era in which communication and information is at its peak), that is tearing
apart communities of all sorts and sizes, and even nations worldwide.

Freedom has been sacrificed in exchange for a status quo that once promised development and advance
whereas corporations embodied an ubiquitous almighty centralized deity.

As technology evolves we are enabled to deal with all new sorts of mechanisms that allow us to better
coordinate as a society. Being *Blockchain* a technology that allows us to build on top of a completely new 
paradigm i.e. *Decentralized Technology*, we are presented -once again- with a new opportunity to re-build 
a society, that of which we might have just dreamed of before.

### Artwork style and background

For this particular work I decided to work the illustrations with a [*ligne claire* style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligne_claire).

This decision was made based upon the research done regarding Moloch deity. In this research I found out that 
Moloch has been portrayed many times throughout the years by different artists, all the way from Literature to 
TV Shows and Cinema.

Being this the case of [*Jacques Martin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Martin_(comics)) a french comic artist and comic book creator that portrayed 
Moloch in a story written by him: "*Le spectre de Carthage*". Jaques Martin was Hergé's apprentice. 
[*Hergé*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herg%C3%A9) was a Belgian world renowned cartoonist, creator of *The Adventures of Tintin*, he was the 
creator and pioneer of *ligne claire* drawing style.
